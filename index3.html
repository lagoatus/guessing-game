      <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
      <p>I've lived in many places in the northwest but I was born in 1986 in Salmon, ID. I can't say it's a hometown that I know. I've only been there once since I one years old.
        Most of the last 15 years I've lived here in Oregon. I've also spent time living in South Africa. I worked at a refugee center in Cape Town. Some fun facts, I enjoy spending my spare time out of doors. Mostly I like to bird watch and mountaineer. I happen to be dual-citizen because my mother is Canadian. </p>
